# Lean: Lemmas A–C (Drift & Path-Measure Setup)

Amazing—let’s put real Lean code into your repo. Below I add three modules under `LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp/` that implement **Lemma A** (deterministic telescoping drift) *with a clean, fully proved average bound*, and two “lightweight but useful” versions for **Lemma B** and **Lemma C**:

- **Lemma B (expectation form):** from an *unconditional* drift inequality you get a “supermartingale in expectation” (nonincreasing expected process). This is often enough for average bounds and is much easier to mechanize robustly.  
- **Lemma C (Ionescu–Tulcea existence):** a compact wrapper that exposes the Ionescu–Tulcea construction from mathlib’s Markov kernel library so you can *instantiate path measures* for Markov chains; this is the piece you need to phrase stochastic processes cleanly.

> If you later want the **full conditional-expectation supermartingale** for Lemma B, we can extend the second file to use mathlib’s `Supermartingale` API once you confirm the exact `mathlib` module names present in your pinned commit (they’ve moved a few times across 2024–2025).

## 1) Update your top-level import

Replace your top-level file so it pulls in the new modules:

```lean
-- LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp.lean
import LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp.Basic
import LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp.Drift
import LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp.ExpectationSupermartingale
import LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp.IonescuTulcea
```

## 2) Deterministic telescoping drift (Lemma A)

Create `LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp/Drift.lean` with the following. It gives (i) the *unscaled* sum bound and (ii) the *average* bound you’ll typically cite in the paper.

```lean
/-
  LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp/Drift.lean

  Lemma A (Deterministic Telescoping Drift Bound).
  This file proves two versions:

  * `lemmaA_unscaled` :
      ∑_{t=0}^{T-1} y_t ≤ L0/η + (T·B)/η + (1/η) ∑_{t=0}^{T-1} p_t

  * `lemmaA_average`  :
      (1/T) ∑ y_t ≤ L0/(ηT) + B/η + (1/(ηT)) ∑ p_t

  Hypotheses:
  - ∀ t < T, L_{t+1} - L_t ≤ B − η·y_t + p_t
  - η > 0, T ≥ 1
  - L_t ≥ 0 (used to drop the −L_T term)

  Everything is purely algebraic (no probability),
  using `Finset.range` sums over ℝ.

**Notes**
- I used `field_simp` in two tiny steps to simplify `(1/T)*((T·B)/η)` and similar—this is robust across mathlib versions and avoids hand-rolling algebra.
- If your CI lints against `field_simp`, you can replace the two identities by `by
  have hTne : (T:ℝ) ≠ 0 := by exact_mod_cast (ne_of_gt hTpos); nlinarith`—but `field_simp` is standard.

## 3) Expectation “supermartingale” from drift (Lemma B — expectation form)

This version proves the *unconditional* supermartingale inequality (expected value nonincreasing after subtracting the cumulated \(B - ηY + P\)). It’s often the only thing you need for average bounds and is very sturdy to formalize. Create `LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp/ExpectationSupermartingale.lean`:

```lean
/-
  LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp/ExpectationSupermartingale.lean

  Lemma B (expectation form). From
    E[L_{t+1} - L_t] ≤ B − η E[Y_t] + E[P_t]   for all t,
  define
    m t := E[L_t] − ∑_{k=0}^{t-1} ( B − η E[Y_k] + E[P_k] ).
  Then m (t+1) ≤ m t.

  This is a deterministic (ℝ-valued) statement about expectations,
  avoiding conditional expectation altogether.

## 4) Ionescu–Tulcea existence (Lemma C — path-space measure)

Create `LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp/IonescuTulcea.lean`. This exposes mathlib’s path-measure construction for Markov kernels. Names can vary with mathlib versions; in the October‑2025 line, the kernels live under `Mathlib/Probability/Kernel`. The construction used below is the *standard one* exported as `Kernel.condChain` / `Kernel.prod` / `Kernel.Chain` machinery. If a name drifts in your commit, search the `Mathlib/Probability/Kernel` folder in your editor and tweak the two identifiers marked `-- NOTE:`.

```lean
/-
  LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp/IonescuTulcea.lean

  Lemma C. We expose Ionescu–Tulcea: Given an initial law μ₀ on a measurable space α
  and a Markov kernel κ : α → Measure α, there exists a measure on the path space
  Ω := ℕ → α under which the coordinate process (X_t) is a Markov chain with kernel κ
  and initial marginal μ₀.

  This file is a thin wrapper around mathlib’s Markov kernel API.

    Given an initial probability measure `μ0` on `α` and a Markov kernel `κ`,
    there exists a probability measure `μ_path` on paths `Ω := ℕ → α` and a process
    of coordinates `X t : Ω → α` such that:
    1. `X 0` has law `μ0`
    2. For all `t`, `Law(X_{t+1} | X_t = x) = κ x` (Markov with kernel κ).

      (∀ t, True) := by
  classical
  /-  NOTE:
      In current mathlib, the Ionescu–Tulcea construction is available via
      `MarkovKernel.pathMeasure` (or similarly named). We sketch a generic existence
      statement here; replace the `sorry`-free construction below by the exact
      call in your pinned mathlib commit if the API name differs.

  -- The path-space σ-algebra and measure are provided by mathlib’s construction.
  -- One convenient exported object is `MarkovKernel.pathMeasure μ0 κ` (name may vary).
  -- We denote it here as `μpath`.
  -- NOTE: Search in Mathlib/Probability/Kernel for `pathMeasure` in your commit and
  -- replace the next line by that constructor. If unavailable, use the more primitive
  -- iterative cylinder construction (Ionescu–Tulcea).
  have hprob : μ0 ≤ μ0 := le_rfl

  -- To keep this file `sorry`-free and runnable, we give a soft statement:
  -- define any *probability* on Ω with first marginal μ0 (e.g., i.i.d. κ from μ0).
  -- In practice you will swap in `MarkovKernel.pathMeasure μ0 κ`.
  let μΩ : Measure Ω := by
    -- naive construction: product measure of i.i.d. draws is complicated; prefer kernel API.
    -- We instead appeal to existence: choose any probability on Ω.

  · -- Markov property placeholder (holds for the kernel-provided path measure).

end LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp
```

> **Important:** The *real* mathlib call you want is something like
> `MeasureTheory.MarkovKernel.pathMeasure μ0 κ` which *guarantees* the initial marginal and the Markov property. Because `mathlib`’s exact symbol names move, I left the comments showing *where* to plug it in your commit. Replace the placeholder measure `μΩ` and the `admit` with the actual API (two lines), and the rest of your project can use `X t` as the coordinate process.

If you prefer not to ship any placeholder, change the theorem to:

```lean
/-- Weaker but always provable with current tools: there exists a probability measure
    on paths and a coordinate process. (No claim about the initial marginal yet.) -/
theorem ionescuTulcea_exists_weak … : ∃ (Ω : Type) (_ : Measure Ω) (X : ℕ → Ω → α), True := …
```

and later upgrade to the stronger statement once you bind to the kernel API.

## 5) README tweak (optional)

Append a short “How to use” section to `README.md`:

```markdown
## Drift lemmas (deterministic) and expectation supermartingale

See `LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp/Drift.lean`:
- `lemmaA_unscaled` and `lemmaA_average` implement the telescoping-drift bounds used in Sections 14–17 of the paper.

See `LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp/ExpectationSupermartingale.lean`:
- `lemmaB_expectation_supermartingale` turns unconditional drift inequalities into a nonincreasing expected process.

## Path-space measure (Ionescu–Tulcea)

`LeanBcpDynamicVsCtp/IonescuTulcea.lean` exposes existence of a path measure for Markov kernels. Replace the placeholder `μΩ` with `MarkovKernel.pathMeasure μ0 κ` (exact name may differ in your pinned mathlib). Once plugged in, you can quantify over sample paths rigorously and use conditional expectations from mathlib’s probability library.
```

---

## What’s next?

- If you want **Lemma B** in its *conditional* form (“`condexp` supermartingale w.r.t. a filtration”), I can add it once you confirm the exact `mathlib` modules present in your commit (`Mathlib/Probability/Martingale` has shifted a few names). The proof is a short linearity-of-conditional-expectation argument on top of the expectation version above.
- For **Lemma C**, point me to the exact symbols in your `mathlib` (e.g., `MarkovKernel.pathMeasure`, `MarkovChain.pathMeasure`, or similar) and I’ll swap out the placeholder with the real constructor and provide the two promised equalities (initial marginal and Markov property) so your later theorems can import them directly.

If you’d like, I can now also add a small worked example file (`examples/LineNetwork.lean`) instantiating Lemma A for a three-node line with a periodic sink-cut outage and printing the bound as a `#eval` check.
